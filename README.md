# Git Flow Lab

A simple web page to practice Git flow workflows.

## Features

### Theme Toggle

A toggle button has been added to the header to switch between a light and a dark theme. The theme state is managed by a `data-theme` attribute on the `<body>` element.

- **Light Theme (Default)**: Background color is #f6f8fa.
- **Dark Theme**: The body background changes to #121212, and the text color becomes #e0e0e0 for better readability.

The button listens for click events and updates the `data-theme` attribute, which in turn triggers the CSS styles.
